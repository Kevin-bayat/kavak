  "service.desc.arch":"Kavak architecture is a design and implementation company. For the company, the concept of land has a high value. As such, it attempts to envision the reality of creativity and to achieve it. It perseveres to build and be, hoping to realize its vision of the experience on the land, and You can see the realization of this diamond. At the first glance, having an executive view, may seem to be in conflict with creativity. But no building can be constructed as long as these two opposites join in life together. To establish a presence in the implementation arena, we need to combine knowledge, accuracy and experience. At the same time, we must retain creativity, freedom, identity and self-awareness. This harmony flows through our original architectural contemplation in our quest to achieve a new reality. For us, the architectural concept, is of utmost important, as in facing the challenges, throughout the project, it acts as a tie, binding together all our concerns. This is what it means to create a project. From a technical perspective, the concept of the project is forms in each stage through a back and force between design and production, to ensure a project is realized in a way that every element within the final product meets the user requirement, while still retaining its reason to exist. We consider our calling to convey to our customer, a feeling of triumph, happiness and ultimately a persistent positive feeling regarding the quality of the space.",
  "service.INTERIOR":"INTERIOR DESIGN",
  "service.INTERIOR.desc":" In architecture, every interior design needs the soul of life to flow through. This principle cannot be realized unless certain personal elements are added and laid out in conjunction with no interruption in the tie of concepts, while also ensuring all material and immaterial needs of the user are met. Regarding these elements, Interior design is the art of viewing the living space through the lens of detail, and the purpose is to convert a space, that could be anyone’s to one which defines the identity of itself, its occupants, and how they live within the space. It is true that this part of the design process depends heavily on the user’s personal taste. However, the architect still plays two roles in the design: First, forming a comprehensive view of the interior and exterior as a single whole, in a way that the interior design can connect to the spirit of the space, and convey a ubiquitous message; and second, creating a space in accordance with the user’s expectations, but with higher space quality. The architect is suited for these roles, many years of experiencing and creating various spaces has imbued him with the required perspective and vision.",

  "service.CONSTRUCTION.desc":"One of the main challenges in construction, is the distance between the designer and the constructor's mindset, which may cause the required final product to be significantly different with the designer’s rendered models. To prevent this, the architects from Kavak have committed themselves to construction. What inspires our decision to cover the projects , is the opportunity to experience the formation of the space during a genuine collaboration. We have always viewed design in terms of creating a new phenomenon. Now, its implementation leads to creating a novelty, newer than what was we had in mind. For us, this pure experience never becomes repetitive. When a project enters the implementation phase, there are always challenges and changes in the path. The “as built” plans are never the same as the “second phase” design plans. In such situations, if the design and construction teams are one and the same, there will be both significant savings in time and cost and the outcome of design and implementation will be identical, as long as no significant time and cost is incurred.",

  "title7.article":"DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOLAR PANELS?",
  "desc7.article":"There are currently three main types of domestic solar panels on the market: polycrystalline, monocrystalline, and thin film. ✔ Polycrystalline panels are the cheaper option but are also less efficient ✔ Monocrystalline panels are sleek but expensive",
  "title8.article":"Monocrystalline solar panels",
  "desc8.article":"These panels are called ‘monocrystalline’ because the material used to make them is single-crystal silicon, which is then formed into bars and cut into wafers. Although they tend to be the more expensive option, monocrystalline solar cells are one of the most popular panel types. One of the main reasons for monocrystalline’s popularity is its high efficiency rating. Since a monocrystalline cell is composed of a single crystal, the electrons that generate a flow of electricity have more room to move. As a result, monocrystalline solar cells are more efficient than their polycrystalline counterparts – with an efficiency rating of between 15% to 20%. Their black color and octagonal-shaped cells also make monocrystalline solar panels great for anyone wanting an aesthetically pleasing look for their home.",
  "title9.article":"Polycrystalline solar panels",
  "desc9.article":"Unlike monocrystalline panels, the production of polycrystalline solar cells involves melting silicon and pouring it into a square mould. By doing this, the panels have a blue mosaic look to them, rather than the sleek octagons you see on monocrystalline panels. Since very little silicon is wasted during this manufacturing process, polycrystalline cells tend to be more affordable than monocrystalline panels. They also tend to be more eco-friendly, since they avoid wasting precious materials. However, bear in mind that polycrystalline panels have more than one crystal in each cell, which means there is less freedom for the electrons to move – making them less efficient than monocrystalline solar panels. In fact, the average efficiency rating on these panels is between 13–16%.",
  "title10.article":"Thin film solar panels",
  "desc10.article":"Thin film solar panels are totally different from monocrystalline and polycrystalline solar panels. These flexible solar sheets are created by placing several thin layers of photovoltaic material – either amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, copper indium gallium selenide, or organic PV cells – on top of each other. Depending on the material that is used, the efficiency rating could be anywhere between 7% to 13%. Although thin film panels have a much lower efficiency rating than other types of solar panels, their main asset is how aesthetically pleasing they can be. Rather than having bright blue, bulky panels propped on their roofs, many homeowners would rather have these flat sheets that can blend into the background. Thin film panels are also great for any homes with limited roof space, since they can be wrapped around objects.",

Some manufacturers, notably SunPower, offer a 96-cell panel, used in larger installations for businesses where demand is higher. The overall dimensions of the SunPower model are similar to those of the 60-cell panel. This is due to the manufacturer using smaller individual cells. These are the common dimensions for each: Sizes differ by brand, but never by more than an inch or two. The depth of solar panels is usually between 1.4 and 1.8-inches.",
  "title14.article":"What Size Solar Panels Charge a Battery Bank?",
  "desc14.article":" Off-grid solar energy - where your system doesn't connect to the grid - requires a battery bank. It stores any excess power for use on dull days when power production is limited. 36 solar cells wired in a series produce 18v of power, called a 12v nominal panel, designed to charge a 12v battery. 72 solar cells produce energy to fully charge a 24v battery. A 48v battery bank requires 2 x 72-cell solar panels to generate enough energy to charge it. If you opt for the off-grid route, ensure the equipment/roof is substantial and can support the weight of the panels.",

  "desc15.article":"Are you building an off-grid or grid-tied system? If off-grid, what size battery bank are you hoping to charge? You will need at least one 72-cell or 2 x 60-cells to meet the demand. Are there any physical size restrictions for the amount of power you need to generate vs the required number of solar panels and their optimization? Will the structure/roof support the solar panel's dimensions; if in doubt,consider reinforcing before installation. Does your solar array need to meet the entire or partial energy demands of your household?",
  "title16.article":"FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE NUMBER OF SOLAR PANELS",
  "desc16.article":"Solar panel dimensions vary depending on their expected output. To calculate your ideal system; size, configuration, number of panels,etc., factor in these points: Solar Irradiance It shouldn't be confused with the number of daylight hours; it is the intensity of the heat and the amount of energy it is capable of generating. For instance, the sun in the Sahara Desert (the optimum place on earth to position solar panels) produces more power than those placed in Canada for the same duration. Sunlight Hours The time of year and whereabouts you live affect the hours of sunlight directed at a solar array. In states such as California, the energy demand of households is greater than that in New England. The average requirement is 10,400kWh per year. In California, 7kW systems are sufficient; whereas an 8.8kW system is needed in New England to generate enough power annually. Output is increased by using bigger solar panels or increasing their amount. Climate In hot climates where air-conditioning is constantly running, high demands are asked of a solar array. Additional, larger, or more efficient panels are recommended. In colder climates that rely on electrical heating, the same applies. Solar Panel Efficiency Not all panels are equal; some convert sunlight into electricity more efficiently than others. For example: An 8kW system with low-efficiency panels requires approximately 490ft² roof space.(152m2) Medium-efficiency panels cover around 406ft².(120m2) High-efficiency PV panels need only 358ft² of space.(110m2)",

Feitl says best practices call for solar to be installed through rack installation over spray foam roofing and that crystalline silicon is the primary type of solar panel utilized. Credit: Scalo Solar “It is imperative that the spray foam is protected with silicone- or acrylic-based coatings, which are typically utilized for waterproofing, UV protection and to extend the lifespan of the roof,” he notes. “Because the roof surfaces underneath the solar panels may not dry as fast as the uncovered portions, it is important that the coating selected is able to withstand pooled water and biological growth.” Furthermore, Feitl says a spray foam roof will be stressed during the installation of photovoltaics, as well as during regular maintenance. “The addition of the solar system on a spray foam roof will lead to additional foot traffic over time. Trafficked areas may be protected with additional coating and granules or walk pads.”",
  "title22.article":"Solar Installation 101",
  "desc23.article":"Carnahan explains that solar solutions are a combination of roofing work and electrical work. “You don’t want to put anything on your roof that would endanger your water-tightness or roofing warranty, so it is important to find an installer who has experience in both,” he notes. “After a careful site analysis that looks at electrical, roofing and structural concerns, solar can be designed specifically with your building in mind.” When installing solar on spray foam roofing, Dave Feitl, Huntsman Building Solutions, points out that owners will want to avoid installing the panels directly onto the spray foam roof surface to prevent solar heat and water accumulation between the panels and rooftop coating. Additionally, the solar system must not block access to drains, penetrations, flashings, mechanical units or other equipment on the roof. Credit: Huntsman Building Solutions For traditional solar panel installation, Carnahan says the “racking” or structural supports that hold the panels are anodized aluminum or stainless steel to maintain a solid physical connection and good product longevity. These systems can then be ballasted, penetrated or a combination of both depending on a number of factors. Carnahan states that a certified solar professional will maintain pathways and accessibility to rooftop equipment and consider long-term safety for maintenance personnel. He also recommends following these tips when it comes to the installation process: Always consult a NABCEP- (North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners) certified installer when considering solar. These experienced installers provide detailed analysis along with turnkey designs and installations, including engineering, permitting, fabrication and construction. Because solar panels have a 25-year warranty, building managers or owners should consider the age of your roof before installing solar. Replacing a roof is the absolute best time to consider going solar, as the roof and solar would both warranty out at approximately the same time. And, be wary of anyone willing to install solar on an old or aging roof that will need to be replaced in the next few years. He notes that solar solutions are no longer for just rooftops; solar can be built into the building’s design with solar canopies, covered walkways, window shades, and even solar parking lots that provide shade and electric vehicle charging to employees or patrons.",
